## Intentionally Missing Features

No language is perfect. The following are some seemingly obvious omissions in GLS that are due to languages not supporting them:

| Feature             | C# | Java     | Python   | Ruby | TypeScript  |
|---------------------|----|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| Multiline Lambdas   |    |          | Missing! |      |             |
| Optional Parameters |    | Missing! |          |      |             |

This list will grow as features are requested.
